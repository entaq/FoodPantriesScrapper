# FoodPantriesScrapper
A simple Python based scrapper to create spreadsheet of food pantries

This Python script will scrape through FoodPantries.org to create a CSV/spreadsheet that will provide easy to access address and contact information for a given food pantry

Uses [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) to drive through to each page and look at the address.
